# Run Applications

> Note that OAM is an alpha feature that is disabled by default. Make sure you
> installed the Crossplane Helm chart with the `--set alpha.oam.enabled=true`
> flag enabled before following this part of the guide.

Crossplane strives to be the best Kubernetes add-on to provision and manage the
infrastructure and services your applications need directly from kubectl. A huge
part of this mission is arriving at an elegant, flexible way to model and manage
cloud native applications. Crossplane allows your team to deploy and run
applications using the [Open Application Model] (OAM).

OAM is a team-centric model for cloud native apps. Like Crossplane, OAM focuses
on the different people who might be involved in the deployment of a cloud
native application. In this getting started guide:

* _Infrastructure Operators_ provide the infrastructure applications need.
* _Application Developers_ build and supply the components of an application.
* _Application Operators_ compose, deploy, and run application configurations.

We'll play the roles of each of these team members as we deploy an application -
Service Tracker - that consists of several services. One of these services, the
`data-api`, is backed by a managed PostgreSQL database that is provisioned
on-demand by Crossplane.

> This guide follows on from the previous one in which we covered defining,
> [composing], and offering infrastructure. You'll need to have defined and
> offered a PostgreSQLInstance with at least one working Composition in order
> to create the OAM application we'll use in this guide.

## Infrastructure Operator

### Install workloads and traits

As the infrastructure operator our work is almost done - we defined, published,
and composed the infrastructure that our application developer and operator
teammates will use in the previous guide. One task remains, which is to define
the [_workloads_] and [_traits_] that our platform supports.

OAM applications consist of workloads, each of which may be modified by traits.
The infrastructure operator may choose which workloads and traits by creating
or deleting `WorkloadDefinitions` and `TraitDefinitions` like below:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: postgresqlinstances.database.example.org
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: postgresqlinstances.database.example.org
---
# The OAM controller needs RBAC access to reconcile any non-core workloads.
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  labels:
    rbac.oam.dev/aggregate-to-controller: "true"
  name: oam:claim:postgresqlinstancesdatabase.example.org:aggregate-to-controller
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - database.example.org
  resources:
  - postgresqlinstances
  verbs:
  - '*'
```

Run the following command to add support for all the workloads and traits required
by this guide:

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crossplane/crossplane/release-1.1/docs/snippets/run/definitions.yaml
```

## Application Developer

### Publish Application Components

Now we'll play the role of the application developer. Our Service Tracker
application consists of a UI service, four API services, and a PostgreSQL
database. Under the Open Application Model application developers define
[_components_] that application operators may compose into applications, which
produce workloads. Creating components allows us as application developers to
communicate any fundamental, suggested, or optional properties of our services
and their infrastructure claims.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: data-api-database
spec:
  workload:
    apiVersion: database.example.org/v1alpha1

```

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crossplane/crossplane/release-1.1/docs/snippets/run/components.yaml
```

Each of the above components describes a particular kind of workload. The
Service Tracker application consists of two kinds of workload:

* A [`ContainerizedWorkload`] is a long-running containerized process.
* A `PostgreSQLInstance` is a PostgreSQL instance and database.

All OAM components configure a kind of workload, and any kind of Kubernetes
resource may act as an OAM workload as long as an infrastructure operator has
allowed it to by authoring a `WorkloadDefinition`.

## Application Operator

### Run The Application

Finally, we'll play the role of an application operator and tie together the
application components and infrastructure that our application developer and
infrastructure operator team-mates have published. In OAM this is done by
authoring an [_application configuration_]:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: ApplicationConfiguration
metadata:
  name: service-tracker
spec:
  components:
    - componentName: data-api-database
      parameterValues:
        - name: database-secret
          value: tracker-database-secret
    - componentName: data-api
      parameterValues:
        - name: database-secret
          value: tracker-database-secret
    - componentName: flights-api
      parameterValues:
        - name: data-uri
          value: "http://data-api.default.svc.cluster.local:3009/"
      traits:
        - trait:
            apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
            kind: ManualScalerTrait
            metadata:
              name: flights-api
            spec:
              replicaCount: 2
    - componentName: quakes-api
      parameterValues:
        - name: data-uri
          value: "http://data-api.default.svc.cluster.local:3009/"  
      traits:
        - trait:
            apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
            kind: ManualScalerTrait
            metadata:
              name: quakes-api
            spec:
              replicaCount: 2
    - componentName: weather-api
      parameterValues:
        - name: data-uri
          value: "http://data-api.default.svc.cluster.local:3009/"
      traits:
        - trait:
            apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
            kind: ManualScalerTrait
            metadata:
              name: weather-api
            spec:
              replicaCount: 2
    - componentName: service-tracker-ui
      parameterValues:
        - name: flights-uri
          value: "http://flights-api.default.svc.cluster.local:3003/"
        - name: weather-uri
          value: "http://weather-api.default.svc.cluster.local:3015/"
        - name: quakes-uri
          value: "http://quakes-api.default.svc.cluster.local:3012/"
```

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crossplane/crossplane/release-1.1/docs/snippets/run/appconfig.yaml
```

This application configuration names each of components the application
developer created earlier to produce workloads. The application operator may (or
in some cases _must_) provide parameter values for a component in order to
override or specify certain configuration values. Component parameters represent
configuration settings that the component author - the application developer -
deemed to be of interest to application operators.

```yaml
- componentName: data-api-database
  parameterValues:
  - name: database-provider
    value: azure
```

> If you created Compositions for more than one provider in the previous guide
> you can add the above parameter to the `data-api-database` component to choose
> which cloud provider the Service Tracker's database should run on.

You might notice that some components include a [`ManualScalerTrait`]. Traits
augment the workload produced by a component with additional features, allowing
application operators to make decisions about the configuration of a component
without having to involve the developer. The `ManualScalerTrait` allows an
application operator to specify how many replicas should exist of any scalable
kind of workload.

> Note that the OAM spec also includes the concept of an _application scope_.
> Crossplane does not yet support scopes.

## Use The Application

Finally, we'll open and use the Service Tracker application we just deployed.

<ul class="nav nav-tabs">
<li class="active"><a href="#connect-tab-lb" data-toggle="tab">Load Balancer</a></li>
<li><a href="#connect-tab-forward" data-toggle="tab">Port Forward</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<div class="tab-content">
<div class="tab-pane fade in active" id="connect-tab-lb" markdown="1">

If you deployed Service Tracker to a managed cluster like AKS, ACK, EKS, or GKE
with support for load balancer Services you should be able to browse to the IP
of the `web-ui` service on port 8080 - for example <http://10.0.0.1:8080>.

```console
kubectl get svc web-ui -o=jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}
```

</div>
<div class="tab-pane fade" id="connect-tab-forward" markdown="1">

If you're using a cluster that doesn't support load balancer Services, like Kind
or Minikube you can use a port forward instead, and connect to
<http://localhost:8080.>

```console
kubectl port-forward deployment/web-ui 8080
```

</div>
</div>

You should see the Service Tracker dashboard in your browser. Hit 'Refresh Data'
for each of the services to ensure the Service Tracker web UI can connect to its
various data API services and populate its PostgreSQL database:

![Service Tracker Dashboard]

If everything was successful you should be able to browse to Flights,
Earthquakes, or Weather to see what's going on in the world today:

![Service Tracker Flights]

## Clean Up

To shut down your application, simply run:

```console
kubectl delete applicationconfiguration service-tracker
```

If you also wish to delete the components, workload definitions, and trait
definitions we created in this guide, run:

```console
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crossplane/crossplane/release-1.1/docs/snippets/run/components.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crossplane/crossplane/release-1.1/docs/snippets/run/definitions.yaml
